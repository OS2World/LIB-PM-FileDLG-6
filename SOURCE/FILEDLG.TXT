The \bFileOpenDlg\p function displays a dialog box and opens the file selected
by the user. This function returns a handle that can be used to read from
and write to the file, as well as to retrieve information about the file.

\bParameters   Description\p
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
\ihwndOwner\p    Identifies the owner window.

\ipszTitle\p     Points to the null-terminated string that specifies the
             dialog box title. If \ipszTitle\p is NULL then the default value
             "Open File" is used.

\ipszIns\p       Points to the null-terminated string that specifies the
             dialog box instructions. If \ipszIns\p is NULL then the default
             value "Select file or type filename" is used.

\ipszShowSpec\p  Points the the null-terminated string that specifies the
             initial search specifications for the files that are to
             be listed in the file list box.

\iusShowAttr\p   Specifies the attribute(s) of the files that are to be
             listed in the file list box. This parameter can be a
             combination of the following values

             \bValue          Meaning\p
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
             \iFILE_NORMAL\p    List all normal files.

             \iFILE_READONLY\p  List read-only files.

             \iFILE_HIDDEN\p    List hidden files.

             \iFILE_SYSTEM\p    List system files.

             \iFILE_ARCHIVED\p  List archived files.

\ipfnHelpProc\p  Points to the user supplied help procedure. This procedure
             is called whenever the help button or the F1 key is pressed.
             The HelpProc function is defined as follows:

             void EXPENTRY HelpProc( HWND hDlg )
             The hDlg parameter is a handle to the open file dialog box.

             When the help procedure is called, the identity of the
             dialog box that requested the help can be determined
             by a call to WinQueryWindowUShort(hDlg,QWS_ID). The
             value returned can be one of the following:

                \iFDLG_OPEN\p ..... Help requested by open dialog box.
                \iFDLG_FIND\p ..... Help requested by find file dialog box.
                \iFDLG_SAVE\p ..... Help requested by save file dialog box.

             If no help is available, set the \ipfnHelpProc\p parameter to
             NULL. This will cause the Help button to be removed from
             the dialog box.

\ipszFileName\p  Points to the location where the fully qualified filename of
             the file selected by the user is to be stored. Use the
             \bDosQSysInfo\p function to get the maximum path length in order
             to determine how large to make the memory block pointed to
             by \ipszFile\p.

\iphf\p          Points to the variable that receives the handle of the opened
             file.

\ipusAction\p    Points to the variable receiving the value that specifies the
             action taken by the FileOpenDlg function. If the dialog box is
             cancelled then this value has no meaning. Otherwise, it is
             one of the following values:

             \bValue           Meaning\p
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
             \iFILE_CREATED\p    File was created.

             \iFILE_EXISTED\p    File already existed.

             \iFILE_TRUNCATED\p  File existed and was truncated.

\iulFileSize\p   Specifies the file's new size (in bytes). This parameter
             applies only if the file is created or truncated. The size
             specification has no effect on a file that is opened only for
             reading.

\iusAttribute\p  Specifies the file attributes. This parameter can be a
             combination of the following values:

             \bValue          Meaning\p
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
             \iFILE_NORMAL\p    File can be read from or written to.

             \iFILE_READONLY\p  File can be read from, but not written to.

             \iFILE_HIDDEN\p    File is hidden and does not appear in a
                            directory listing.

             \iFILE_SYSTEM\p    File is a system file.

             \iFILE_ARCHIVED\p  File has been archived.

             File attributes apply only if the file is created.

\ifsOpenFlags\p  Specifies the action to take both when the file exists and when
             it does not exist. This parameter may be one of the following
             values:

             \bValue                        Meaning\p
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
             \iFILE_CREATE\p                  Create a new file; fail if the
                                          file already exists.

             \iFILE_OPEN\p                    Open an existing file; fail if the
                                          file does not exist.

             \iFILE_OPEN | FILE_CREATE\p      Open an existing file or create
                                          the file if it does not exist.

             \iFILE_TRUNCATE\p                Open an existing file and change
                                          to a given size.

             \iFILE_TRUNCATE | FILE_CREATE\p  Open an existing file and truncate
                                          it, or create the file if it does
                                          not exist.

\ifsOpenMode\p   Specifies the modes with which to open the file. It consists of
             one access mode and one share mode. The other values are
             optional and can be given in any combination:

             \bValue                     Meaning\p
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
             \iOPEN_ACCESS_READONLY\p      Data may be read from the file but
                                       not written to it.

             \iOPEN_ACCESS_READWRITE\p     Data may be read from or written to
                                       the file.

             \iOPEN_ACCESS_WRITEONLY\p     Data may be written to the file but
                                       not read from it.

             \iOPEN_SHARE_DENYNONE\p       Other processes can open the file for
                                       any access: read-only, write-only, or
                                       read-write.

             \iOPEN_SHARE_DENYREAD\p       Other processes can open the file for
                                       write-only access but they cannot
                                       open it for read-only or read-write
                                       access.

             \iOPEN_SHARE_DENYREADWRITE\p  The current process has exclusive
                                       access to the file. The file cannot
                                       be opened by any process (including
                                       the current process).

             \iOPEN_SHARE_DENYWRITE\p      Other processes can open the file for
                                       read-only access but they cannot open
                                       it for write-only or read-write
                                       access.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_FAIL_ON_ERROR\p  Any function that uses the file
                                       handle returns immediately with an
                                       error value if there is an I/O
                                       error--for example, when the drive
                                       door is open or a sector is missing.
                                       If this value is not specified, the
                                       system passes the error to the system
                                       critical-error handler, which then
                                       reports the error to the user with a
                                       hard-error popup. The fail-on-error
                                       flag is not inherited by child
                                       processes.

                                       The fail-on-error flag applies to all
                                       functions that use the file handle,
                                       with the exception of the
                                       DosDevIOCtl function.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_NOINHERIT\p      The file handle is not available to
                                       any child process started by the
                                       current process. If this value is not
                                       specified, any child process started
                                       by the current process may use the
                                       file handle.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_WRITE_THROUGH\p  This flag applies to functions, such
                                       as DosWrite, that write data to the
                                       file. If this value is specified, the
                                       system writes data to the device
                                       before the given function returns.
                                       Otherwise, the system may store the
                                       data in an internal file buffer and
                                       write the data to the device only
                                       when the buffer is full or the file
                                       is closed.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_NO_LOCALITY\p       There is no specific information
                                          regarding the locality of
                                          reference (the degree of
                                          randomness with which the file is
                                          accessed).

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_SEQUENTIAL\p        The file is accessed
                                          sequentially.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_RANDOM\p            The file is accessed randomly.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_RANDOMSEQUENTIAL\p  The file is accessed randomly, but
                                          that there is a degree of
                                          sequential I/O within that random
                                          access. For example, this flag is
                                          specified if large blocks of data
                                          are to be read or written at
                                          random locations in the file.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_NO_CACHE\p          The disk drive should not cache
                                          data in I/O operations on this
                                          file.
\iulReserved\p   Specifies a reserved value; must be zero.

\bReturn Value\p

The return value may be one of the following:

    FDLG_OK
    FDLG_CANCEL

\bComments\p

On exit from this function, hard-error processing will be enabled.

The \bFileSaveDlg\p function displays a dialog box and opens the file selected
by the user. This function returns a handle that can be used to read from
and write to the file, as well as to retrieve information about the file.

Parameters   Description
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
\ihwndOwner\p    Identifies the owner window.

\ipszTitle\p     Points to the null-terminated string that specifies the
             dialog box title. If \ipszTitle\p is NULL then the default value
             "Save File" is used.

\ipszIns\p       Points to the null-terminated string that specifies the
             dialog box instructions. If \ipszIns\p is NULL then the default
             value "Type filename" is used.

\ipfnHelpProc\p  Points to the user supplied help procedure. This procedure
             is called whenever the help button or the F1 key is pressed.
             The HelpProc function is defined as follows:

             The hDlg parameter is a handle to the save file dialog box.

             When the help procedure is called, the identity of the
             dialog box that requested the help can be determined
             by a call to WinQueryWindowUShort(hDlg,QWS_ID). The
             value returned can be one of the following:

                \iFDLG_OPEN\p ..... Help requested by open dialog box.
                \iFDLG_FIND\p ..... Help requested by find file dialog box.
                \iFDLG_SAVE\p ..... Help requested by save file dialog box.

             If no help is available, set the \ipfnHelpProc\p parameter to
             NULL. This will cause the Help button to be removed from
             the dialog box.

\ipszDefault\p   Points to the null-terminated string that specifies the
             default save file name.

\ipszFileName\p  Points to the location where the fully qualified filename of
             the file selected by the user is to be stored. Use the
             \bDosQSysInfo\p function to get the maximum path length in order
             to determine how large to make the memory block pointed to
             by \ipszFile\p.

\iphf\p          Points to the variable that receives the handle of the opened
             file.

\ipusAction\p    Points to the variable receiving the value that specifies the
             action taken by the FileOpenDlg function. If the dialog box is
             cancelled then this value has no meaning. Otherwise, it is
             one of the following values:

             \bValue           Meaning\p
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
             \iFILE_CREATED\p    File was created.

             \iFILE_EXISTED\p    File already existed.

             \iFILE_TRUNCATED\p  File existed and was truncated.

\iulFileSize\p   Specifies the file's new size (in bytes). This parameter
             applies only if the file is created or truncated. The size
             specification has no effect on a file that is opened only for
             reading.

\iusAttribute\p  Specifies the file attributes. This parameter can be a
             combination of the following values:

             \bValue          Meaning\p
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
             \iFILE_NORMAL\p    File can be read from or written to.

             \iFILE_READONLY\p  File can be read from, but not written to.

             \iFILE_HIDDEN\p    File is hidden and does not appear in a
                            directory listing.

             \iFILE_SYSTEM\p    File is a system file.

             \iFILE_ARCHIVED\p  File has been archived.

             File attributes apply only if the file is created.

\ifsOpenFlags\p  Specifies the action to take both when the file exists and when
             it does not exist. This parameter may be one of the following
             values:

             \bValue                        Meaning\p
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
             \iFILE_CREATE\p                  Create a new file; fail if the
                                          file already exists.

             \iFILE_OPEN\p                    Open an existing file; fail if the
                                          file does not exist.

             \iFILE_OPEN | FILE_CREATE\p      Open an existing file or create
                                          the file if it does not exist.

             \iFILE_TRUNCATE\p                Open an existing file and change
                                          to a given size.

             \iFILE_TRUNCATE | FILE_CREATE\p  Open an existing file and truncate
                                          it, or create the file if it does
                                          not exist.

\ifsOpenMode\p   Specifies the modes with which to open the file. It consists of
             one access mode and one share mode. The other values are
             optional and can be given in any combination:

             \bValue                     Meaning\p
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
             \iOPEN_ACCESS_READONLY\p      Data may be read from the file but
                                       not written to it.

             \iOPEN_ACCESS_READWRITE\p     Data may be read from or written to
                                       the file.

             \iOPEN_ACCESS_WRITEONLY\p     Data may be written to the file but
                                       not read from it.

             \iOPEN_SHARE_DENYNONE\p       Other processes can open the file for
                                       any access: read-only, write-only, or
                                       read-write.

             \iOPEN_SHARE_DENYREAD\p       Other processes can open the file for
                                       write-only access but they cannot
                                       open it for read-only or read-write
                                       access.

             \iOPEN_SHARE_DENYREADWRITE\p  The current process has exclusive
                                       access to the file. The file cannot
                                       be opened by any process (including
                                       the current process).

             \iOPEN_SHARE_DENYWRITE\p      Other processes can open the file for
                                       read-only access but they cannot open
                                       it for write-only or read-write
                                       access.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_FAIL_ON_ERROR\p  Any function that uses the file
                                       handle returns immediately with an
                                       error value if there is an I/O
                                       error--for example, when the drive
                                       door is open or a sector is missing.
                                       If this value is not specified, the
                                       system passes the error to the system
                                       critical-error handler, which then
                                       reports the error to the user with a
                                       hard-error popup. The fail-on-error
                                       flag is not inherited by child
                                       processes.

                                       The fail-on-error flag applies to all
                                       functions that use the file handle,
                                       with the exception of the
                                       DosDevIOCtl function.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_NOINHERIT\p      The file handle is not available to
                                       any child process started by the
                                       current process. If this value is not
                                       specified, any child process started
                                       by the current process may use the
                                       file handle.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_WRITE_THROUGH\p  This flag applies to functions, such
                                       as DosWrite, that write data to the
                                       file. If this value is specified, the
                                       system writes data to the device
                                       before the given function returns.
                                       Otherwise, the system may store the
                                       data in an internal file buffer and
                                       write the data to the device only
                                       when the buffer is full or the file
                                       is closed.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_NO_LOCALITY\p       There is no specific information
                                          regarding the locality of
                                          reference (the degree of
                                          randomness with which the file is
                                          accessed).

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_SEQUENTIAL\p        The file is accessed
                                          sequentially.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_RANDOM\p            The file is accessed randomly.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_RANDOMSEQUENTIAL\p  The file is accessed randomly, but
                                          that there is a degree of
                                          sequential I/O within that random
                                          access. For example, this flag is
                                          specified if large blocks of data
                                          are to be read or written at
                                          random locations in the file.

             \iOPEN_FLAGS_NO_CACHE\p          The disk drive should not cache
                                          data in I/O operations on this
                                          file.

\iulReserved\p   Specifies a reserved value; must be zero.

\bReturn Value\p

The return value may be one of the following:

    FDLG_OK
    FDLG_CANCEL

\bComments\p

On exit from this function, hard-error processing will be enabled.
